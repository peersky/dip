/**
 * This script automates the process of fixing 'Unknown' data in the database.
 * It performs two main functions:
 * 1. Generates SQL UPDATE statements based on a "last known valid state" heuristic.
 * 2. Automatically finds the most recent migration folder ending in '_data_fix_unknowns'
 *    and writes the generated SQL directly into its 'migration.sql' file.
 *
 * This eliminates the need for manual copy-pasting and makes the data-fixing
 * process safer and more reliable.
 *
 * To use this script:
 * 1. First, create an empty migration:
 *    (from `packages/database`)
 *    `pnpm prisma migrate dev --create-only --name data-fix-unknowns`
 *
 * 2. Then, run this script to populate that migration file:
 *    (from `packages/core`)
 *    `pnpm ts-node src/writeDataFixMigration.ts`
 *
 * 3. Finally, apply the now-populated migration:
 *    (from `packages/database`)
 *    `pnpm prisma migrate dev`
